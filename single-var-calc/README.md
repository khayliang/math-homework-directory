# Single Variable Calculus
I completed this course before I bought my iPad. All my homework and exams are on paper.

I wrote [notes in Notion](https://bolder-spike-e07.notion.site/Single-Variable-Calculus-afef2c1429ba425b9c51c1b8767d6d76) though. It was when I was trying out the effectiveness of note taking in mathematics.
