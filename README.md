## Why study mathematics?
I realized after some time that there is only so much cool things I can accomplish through coding without fundamentals in mathematics and science, so I decided to do a bunch of courses by MIT and other colleges to bring myself up to speed. 

Eventually though, I started to do math in its own right. Math became a giant puzzle that was enjoyable by itself, and I found out that it could scratch the logical problem solving itch that was originally associated with programming. Studying math also felt like I was living in an RPG, and completing math courses felt like unlocking parts of a skill tree.

## How did I study?
This was done during my stay in the Army, beginning in the end of June 2021. I did approximately 3-4 courses at a time, following the schedule provided by the course description. But because of how the Army is, I couldn't stick to a regular schedule and things got delayed. 

Initially, I tried to give myself a full undergraduate education by the time I done in the Army. I went to MIT's math/cs undergraduate program requirements, and worked on the the topics listed there with full courses available on OCW. At the progress I'm currently at however, I doubt I can pull it off.

Anyways, for each course, I'd try to stick to the semester's calendar, work through each week's problem set and grade them. When it was time for exams, I placed myself in an exam environment too. I limited the amount of time I had to revise to the same amount as the students in the course, and timed myself for papers to try to simulate a fun college experience.

### Why is everything handwritten?
In the army, I'm not allowed to bring a computer outside of the barracks. The best I could do was to sneak out an iPad during work hours. The iPad was inconspicuous enough to escape detection (though it was still banned). 

## What did I gain from mathematics?
### Habits of learning
Before I started this journey, I've always thought that I was very capable with math in class. My grades for tougher math courses back in Pre-U were mostly Cs and Bs. I looked up to the kids taking A levels with their Further Math and H3 Math, as doing well in math along side other demanding subjects felt like a herculean task — one that required some innate capability, which I probably didn't possess.

Working through all these courses on my own without personalized guidance showed me what I was lacking: proper study habits. Previously, I thought math was something that could be done through understanding only. I read through lecture notes, work on some exercises, then called it a day. But when exams came, all that I've done previously disappeared from my mind, and I'd flunk the papers.

This was even worse in the army, as there were significant gaps in time where I couldn't study. I also took a really long break to study Cambridge STEP. Whenever I came back to where I left off, I couldn't understand anything and had to redo from the start. To resolve this, I started using spaced repetition to memorize theorems, definitions, and practice proofs that contain key tricks and ideas. This was a gamechanger. By memorization, I could better grok problems in math since all the key information were now embedded in my mind instead of a book. When exams came in, there weren't much I had to revise for other than practicing the past papers. 
### Time waster
With math, I feel like I can even survive time in prison as long as I've got a textbook, pencil, and paper.
