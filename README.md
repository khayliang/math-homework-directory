## Why study mathematics?
I realized after some time that there is only so much cool things I can accomplish through coding without fundamentals in mathematics and science, so I decided to do a bunch of courses by MIT and other colleges to bring myself up to speed. 

Eventually though, I started to do math in its own right. Math became a giant puzzle that was enjoyable by itself, and I found out that it could scratch the logical problem solving itch that was originally associated with programming. Studying math also felt like I was living in an RPG, and completing math courses felt like unlocking parts of a skill tree.
### Why is everything handwritten?
In the army, I'm not allowed to bring a computer outside of the barracks. The best I could do was to sneak out an iPad during work hours. The iPad was inconspicuous enough to escape detection (though it was still banned).
