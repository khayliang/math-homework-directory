# Conclusions
Really fun course. Quite tedious because of all the memorization but definitely Learnt a lot. Could have gotten a way higher score for exam 3 if I revised or did some past years, but I can't be bothered. Wanted to just get this course over and done with. Also messed up exam 1 since I didn't do flashcards for lecture slides.

Overall, I'm decently satisfied with my performance. Probably would just get a B though.
